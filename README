This folder contains the dockerfiles for creating the image for the ConPaaS container.

In the base folder there is a dockerfile which generates a base image which consists
of an ubuntu distro plus all the dependencies required by ConPaaS. This image is quite 
static and needs to be crated only once.

In the contpaas folder there is a docker file which generates an image where the latest 
version of the Harness branch of ConPaaS is installed. This image is based on the base image
and can be generated everytime there is a modification in ConPaaS.

Once a container with contpaas image is running you need to configure the ConPaaS director in order to communicate with the CRS:
#sed -i '/SPEEDFACTOR/a\DRIVER = harness\nIMAGE_ID = 47e73132-5e31-4f0a-a9c9-76365a27ed28\nHOST = http://localhost:56789' /etc/cpsdirector/director.cfg
(Change the IMAGE_ID and HOST accordingly)

and restart the apache server:
#service apache2 restart
